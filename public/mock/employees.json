This smile is because I can look at myself and know that I've been enjoying some of the best times of my life, and I’m really glad that I've chosen the right thing for rest of it.Tech life aside, in my spare time I always love to go biking, hiking, and love to walk or run.

(Spoiler: I am still a craftsman)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter some travelling and soul searching, I began studying at University. I studied maths, finance and business management, but also computer science.

It was really fun for a while, but - of course - I missed my friends.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI got the chance to join tretton37, and by doing so I get to keep doing what I love, with an even steeper learning curve and surrounded by so many great people - craftsmen and women - and so much knowledge collected under the same…well a few…roofs.
